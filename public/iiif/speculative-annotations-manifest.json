          "This poster shows Old Faithful erupting at Yellowstone National Park. At first, posters were created by hand, individually painted and lettered. Later on, the divisions' artists usually used the silkscreen process, which was adapted and refined for the mass production of posters by project artist Anthony Velonis in 1936. The printing of a poster was a collaborative effort. Artists were responsible for the poster's design, color selection, and sometimes the cutting of the stencils used to print the poster. The workshop's technical staff screened the posters. With this silkscreening process, as many as six hundred posters were printed in a day."

The Federal Theatre Project was the largest and most ambitious effort mounted by the Federal Government to organize and produce theater events. It was an effort of the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to provide work for unemployed professionals in the theater during the Great Depression which followed the stock market crash of October 1929. The Federal Theatre Project was one of four (subsequently five) arts-related projects called Federal Project Number One, established under the Works Progress Administration (WPA) during Roosevelts first term. The WPA was created through Executive Order No. 7034 issued on May 6, 1935.  The FTP was administered from Washington, D. C., but its many companies stretched the full breadth of the Nation. It functioned from 1935 to 1939 when its funding was terminated. In that brief period, it was responsible for some of the most innovative staging of its time."

Handwritten on back is: \"Belle Glade, Fla, poss. 1935\"; \"Zora Hurston.\" Photographs depict African American, white, and Latino musicians, singers and dancers, in the southern United States (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Texas, and Virginia) and the Bahamas (Nassau, Andros Island, and Cat Island). Includes portraits of musicians posed with and without their instruments; many photos show musicians in various settings and activities--at homes, working in prison yards, working on chain gangs, performing outside and on stage at the Asheville Mountain Music Festival, North Carolina. Some photos depict daily life, including domestic activities, baptisms, and farming. Also includes some landscape and marine views, houses, and children playing singing games. Musicians depicted include, among others, Henry Truvillion, James \"Iron Head\" Baker, Moses \"Clear Rock\" Platt, Leadbelly, Crockett \"Davy\" Ward, Bill Hensley, Uncle Bob Ledbetter, and Bascom Lamar Lunsford. Folklorist Zora Neale Hurston, who assisted the Lomaxes on expeditions to Georgia and Florida, is identified in four photographs in subdivisions 7414-C and 7414-G. Unlike many anthropoligists at that time, Hurston believed in integrating herself as an anthropologist and folklorist into the communities and cultures she was studying."

          "The photographs of the Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944. This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy E. Stryker, formerly an economics instructor at Columbia University, and employed such photographers as Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, Jack Delano, Marion Post Wolcott, Gordon Parks, John Vachon, and Carl Mydans. The project initially documented cash loans made to individual farmers by the Resettlement Administration and the construction of planned suburban communities. The second stage focused on the lives of sharecroppers in the South and migratory agricultural workers in the midwestern and western states. As the scope of the project expanded, the photographers turned to recording both rural and urban conditions throughout the United States as well as mobilization efforts for World War II. \"From  May to November 1942, Nyssa [pronounced NISS-a], Oregon, served as the site of the first farm labor camp organized during the wartime Japanese American experience. Established as a result of the \" Oregon Plan \" for the forced removal and confinement of the state\\'s Nikkei residents, the camp held approximately three hundred fifty laborers at its peak. These workers provided critical agricultural labor in eastern Oregon\\'s Malheur County. By the summer of 1942, the camp became so well known that the Pacific Citizen referred to it as \"the camp without a fence.\" [1]\" https://encyclopedia.densho.org/Nyssa,_Oregon_(detention_facility)/"
