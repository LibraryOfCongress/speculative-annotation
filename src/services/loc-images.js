Both his mother and wife were deaf, and they inspired him to research hearing and speech throughout his life. Bell was also an advocate of compulsory sterilization, the practice of forcing a specific group of people not to be able to have children because of their race, sex, sexual orientation, or a perceived disability. This is a page from one of Bell's scientific notebooks where he describes some of his first experiments with the telephone.",
